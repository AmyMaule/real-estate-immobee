## About the project

[immobee.app](https://immobee.app/) is an open-source project designed to streamline the process of searching for properties for sale in a particular region by aggregating real estate agent data from various sources into a single platform. 

This repository contains the frontend code for ImmoBee, that queries various APIs that scrape estate agent data so that listings from all agents can be viewed together in one place.

All of the backend code for this project including APIs and scrapers can be found [here](https://github.com/suspiciousleaf/immo_app).
